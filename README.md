# SQL-Practice
SQL questions and exercises for practice

# Practice your SQL.
The objective of this exercise is to acquaint oneself with SQL statements. It's important to thoroughly review your work. Simply receiving a response from SQL doesn't necessarily mean it's correct. Ensure that the output makes sense and that it isn't returning an excessive number of rows when it should only be returning a few.
